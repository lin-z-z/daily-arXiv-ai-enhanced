Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \\$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To demonstrate framework's versatility, our implementation uses three modalities - speech, text and facial imagery. However, the system is fully modular, and can be extended to support other modalities or tasks. Each modality is processed through a dedicated backbone optimized for inference efficiency: Emotion2Vec for speech, a ResNet-based model for facial expressions, and DistilRoBERTa for text. To reconcile uncertainty across modalities, we introduce a model- and task-agnostic fusion mechanism grounded in Dempster-Shafer theory and Dirichlet evidence. Operating directly on model logits, this approach captures predictive uncertainty without requiring additional training or joint distribution estimation, making it broadly applicable beyond emotion recognition. Validation on five benchmark datasets (eNTERFACE05, MEAD, MELD, RAVDESS and CREMA-D) show that our method achieves competitive accuracy while remaining computationally efficient and robust to ambiguous or missing inputs. Overall, the proposed framework emphasizes modularity, scalability, and real-world feasibility, paving the way toward uncertainty-aware multimodal systems for healthcare, human-computer interaction, and other emotion-informed applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose Progress-Aware Belief Update (PABU), a belief-state framework that compactly represents an agent's state by explicitly modeling task progress and selectively retaining past actions and observations. At each step, the agent predicts its relative progress since the previous round and decides whether the newly encountered interaction should be stored, conditioning future decisions only on the retained subset. Across eight environments in the AgentGym benchmark, and using identical training trajectories, PABU achieves an 81.0% task completion rate, outperforming previous State of the art (SoTA) models with full-history belief by 23.9%. Additionally, PABU's progress-oriented action selection improves efficiency, reducing the average number of interaction steps to 9.5, corresponding to a 26.9% reduction.

We propose Contribution-Aware Medical Multi-Agents (CoMMa), a decentralized LLM-agent framework in which specialists operate on partitioned evidence and coordinate through a game-theoretic objective for robust decision-making. In contrast to most agent architectures relying on stochastic narrative-based reasoning, CoMMa utilizes deterministic embedding projections to approximate contribution-aware credit assignment. This yields explicit evidence attribution by estimating each agent's marginal utility, producing interpretable and mathematically grounded decision pathways with improved stability. Evaluated on diverse oncology benchmarks, including a real-world multidisciplinary tumor board dataset, CoMMa achieves higher accuracy and more stable performance than data-centralized and role-based multi-agents baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Maintaining these resources requires expert curators to search relevant papers, reconcile evidence across documents, and produce ontology-grounded annotations - a workflow that existing benchmarks, focused on isolated subtasks like named entity recognition or relation extraction, do not capture. We present FlyBench to evaluate AI agents on end-to-end agentic ontology curation from scientific literature. Given only a gene symbol, agents must search and read from a corpus of 16,898 full-text papers to produce structured annotations: Gene Ontology terms describing function, expression patterns, and historical synonyms linking decades of nomenclature. The benchmark includes 7,397 expert-curated annotations across 100 genes drawn from FlyBase, the Drosophila (fruit fly) knowledge base. We evaluate four baseline agent architectures: memorization, fixed pipeline, single-agent, and multi-agent. We find that architectural choices significantly impact performance, with multi-agent designs outperforming simpler alternatives, yet scaling backbone models yields diminishing returns. All baselines leave substantial room for improvement. Our analysis surfaces several findings to guide future development; for example, agents primarily use retrieval to confirm parametric knowledge rather than discover new information. We hope FlyBench will drive progress on retrieval-augmented scientific reasoning, a capability with broad applications across scientific domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this gap, we introduce a framework based on topological data analysis (TDA) and persistence landscapes (PLs) to extract and quantify geometric features from data. This approach provides a theoretically grounded means of measuring diversity beyond entropy, capturing the rich geometric and structural properties of datasets.

We introduce AgentAuditor, which replaces voting with a path search over a Reasoning Tree that explicitly represents agreements and divergences among agent traces. AgentAuditor resolves conflicts by comparing reasoning branches at critical divergence points, turning global adjudication into efficient, localized verification. We further propose Anti-Consensus Preference Optimization (ACPO), which trains the adjudicator on majority-failure cases and rewards evidence-based minority selections over popular errors. AgentAuditor is agnostic to MAS setting, and we find across 5 popular settings that it yields up to 5% absolute accuracy improvement over a majority vote, and up to 3% over using LLM-as-Judge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faAgentAuditor\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u8def\u5f84\u641c\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u6765\u805a\u5408\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cd\u5171\u8bc6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(ACPO)\u8bad\u7ec3\u88c1\u51b3\u5668\uff0c\u57285\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad85%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4LLM\u88c1\u5224\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad83%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u805a\u5408\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u5173\u504f\u89c1\u5e76\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u7684\"\u865a\u6784\u5171\u8bc6\"\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u6b67\u548c\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentAuditor\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u4e0a\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u641c\u7d22\u66ff\u4ee3\u6295\u7968\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u5206\u6b67\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5206\u6b67\u70b9\u6bd4\u8f83\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u652f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u88c1\u51b3\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u5171\u8bc6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(ACPO)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6570\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u88c1\u51b3\u5668\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u5c11\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u800c\u975e\u6d41\u884c\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cAgentAuditor\u76f8\u6bd4\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad85%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad83%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentAuditor\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u6811\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u53cd\u5171\u8bc6\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u6784\u5171\u8bc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u548cLLM\u88c1\u5224\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f93\u51fa\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, statistics-based solutions are generally prone to adversarial attacks that contain logic based modifications such as negation in phrases and sentences. In that regard, we present a set of formal reasoning-based methodologies that wrap around existing machine learning toxicity detection systems. Acting as both pre-processing and post-processing steps, our formal reasoning wrapper helps alleviating the negation attack problems and significantly improves the accuracy and efficacy of toxicity scoring. We evaluate different variations of our wrapper on multiple machine learning models against a negation adversarial dataset.

Physics demands that a model maintain physical consistency with the laws governing the universe, a task that fundamentally requires multimodal perception to ground abstract logic in reality. At the Olympiad level, diagrams are often constitutive rather than illustrative, containing essential constraints, such as boundary conditions and spatial symmetries, that are absent from the text. To bridge this visual-logical gap, we introduce P1-VL, a family of open-source vision-language models engineered for advanced scientific reasoning. Our method harmonizes Curriculum Reinforcement Learning, which employs progressive difficulty expansion to stabilize post-training, with Agentic Augmentation, enabling iterative self-verification at inference. Evaluated on HiPhO, a rigorous benchmark of 13 exams from 2024-2025, our flagship P1-VL-235B-A22B becomes the first open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) to secure 12 gold medals and achieves the state-of-the-art performance in the open-source models. Our agent-augmented system achieves the No.2 overall rank globally, trailing only Gemini-3-Pro. Beyond physics, P1-VL demonstrates remarkable scientific reasoning capacity and generalizability, establishing significant leads over base models in STEM benchmarks. By open-sourcing P1-VL, we provide a foundational step toward general-purpose physical intelligence to better align visual perceptions with abstract physical laws for machine scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86P1-VL\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u83b7\u5f9712\u679a\u91d1\u724c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5168\u7403\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u4ec5\u6b21\u4e8eGemini-3-Pro\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u5411\u79d1\u5b66\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u73b0\u5b9e\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u951a\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u56fe\u8868\u5f80\u5f80\u5305\u542b\u6587\u672c\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u903b\u8f91\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9-\u903b\u8f91\u9e3f\u6c9f\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u7ea7\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faP1-VL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u8bfe\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08Curriculum Reinforcement Learning\uff09\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u96be\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2) \u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\uff08Agentic Augmentation\uff09\uff1a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f0f\u81ea\u6211\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728HiPhO\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5305\u542b2024-2025\u5e74\u768413\u573a\u8003\u8bd5\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u65d7\u8230\u6a21\u578bP1-VL-235B-A22B\u6210\u4e3a\u9996\u4e2a\u83b7\u5f9712\u679a\u91d1\u724c\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u914d\u5907\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u5168\u7403\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e8c\uff0c\u4ec5\u6b21\u4e8eGemini-3-Pro\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cP1-VL\u5728STEM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u6e90P1-VL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6027\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f7f\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7269\u7406\u5965\u6797\u5339\u514b\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\uff0c\u8fd8\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdbSTEM\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u79d1\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5411\u79d1\u5b66\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, these Long CoTs are often excessively lengthy and contain redundant reasoning steps, which can hinder inference efficiency. Compressing these long CoTs is a natural solution, yet existing approaches face two major challenges: (1) they may compromise the integrity of visual-textual reasoning by removing essential alignment cues, and (2) the compression process lacks explainability, making it difficult to discern which information is critical. To address these problems, we propose XMCC, an eXplainable Multimodal CoT Compressor that formulates compression as a sequential decision-making process optimized via reinforcement learning. XMCC can effectively shorten reasoning trajectories while preserving key reasoning steps and answer correctness, and simultaneously generates natural-language explanations for its compression decisions. Extensive experiments on representative multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that XMCC not only reduces reasoning length but also provides explainable explanations, validating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faXMCC\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u538b\u7f29\u5197\u957f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7f29\u77ed\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u957f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08Long CoTs\uff09\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5197\u957f\u548c\u5305\u542b\u5197\u4f59\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u89c6\u89c9-\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u538b\u7f29\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u54ea\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u662f\u5173\u952e\u7684\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u53c8\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faXMCC\uff08\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u538b\u7f29\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u7f29\u77ed\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u5176\u538b\u7f29\u51b3\u7b56\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cXMCC\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "XMCC\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN overcome this computational hurdle by leveraging in-context learning, so each conditional expectation can be approximated without any re-training. In this paper, we compute Shapley values with multiple variants of TabPFN and compare their performance with state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real datasets. In most cases, TabPFN yields the best performance; where it does not, it is only marginally worse than the best method, at a fraction of the runtime.

This paper addresses the matter of targets detection in radar range profiles containing multiple targets with varying proximity and distorted echoes. Inspired by recent contributions in the radar and signal processing literature, this work proposes partially complex-valued neural networks as an adaptive range profile processing. Simulated datasets are generated and experiments are conducted to compare a common pulse compression approach with a simple neural network partially defined by complex-valued parameters.

In the latter, numerical attributes are represented with predicates and this allows declaring default values, leaving the attribute undefined, making non-deterministic assignments with choice rules or using aggregated values. In CASP, most (if not all) of these features are lost once we switch to a constraint-based representation of those same attributes.

However, due to the autoregressive, step-by-step generation paradigm, existing CoT methods suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, the reasoning process is highly sensitive to early decisions: once an initial error is introduced, it tends to propagate and amplify through subsequent steps, while the lack of a global coordination and revision mechanism makes such errors difficult to correct, ultimately leading to distorted reasoning chains. Second, current CoT approaches lack structured analysis techniques for filtering redundant reasoning and extracting key reasoning features, resulting in unstable reasoning processes and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose GHS-TDA. GHS-TDA first constructs a semantically enriched global hypothesis graph to aggregate, align, and coordinate multiple candidate reasoning paths, thereby providing alternative global correction routes when local reasoning fails. It then applies topological data analysis based on persistent homology to capture stable multi-scale structures, remove redundancy and inconsistencies, and extract a more reliable reasoning skeleton. By jointly leveraging reasoning diversity and topological stability, GHS-TDA achieves self-adaptive convergence, produces high-confidence and interpretable reasoning paths, and consistently outperforms strong baselines in terms of both accuracy and robustness across multiple reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study LLM decision-making in a travel-assistant context by presenting models with choice dilemmas and analyzing their responses using multinomial logit models to derive implied willingness to pay (WTP) estimates. These WTP values are subsequently compared to human benchmark values from the economics literature. In addition to a baseline setting, we examine how model behavior changes under more realistic conditions, including the provision of information about users' past choices and persona-based prompting. Our results show that while meaningful WTP values can be derived for larger LLMs, they also display systematic deviations at the attribute level. Additionally, they tend to overestimate human WTP overall, particularly when expensive options or business-oriented personas are introduced. Conditioning models on prior preferences for cheaper options yields valuations that are closer to human benchmarks.

Our framework features a teacher agent that leverages student policy representations derived from discovered evaluation environments, enabling it to generate training environments based on the student's capabilities. To improve efficiency, we incorporate a generative model that augments the teacher's training dataset with synthetic data, reducing the need for teacher-student interactions. In experiments across several domains, we show that our method outperforms baseline approaches while requiring fewer teacher-student interactions in a single episode. The results suggest the applicability of our approach in settings where training opportunities are limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent efforts leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents to automate this task, yet existing systems exhibit low detection accuracy even with capable models, and current evaluation frameworks assess only final answer correctness without revealing why the agent's reasoning failed. This paper presents a process level failure analysis of LLM-based RCA agents. We execute the full OpenRCA benchmark across five LLM models, producing 1,675 agent runs, and classify observed failures into 12 pitfall types across intra-agent reasoning, inter-agent communication, and agent-environment interaction. Our analysis reveals that the most prevalent pitfalls, notably hallucinated data interpretation and incomplete exploration, persist across all models regardless of capability tier, indicating that these failures originate from the shared agent architecture rather than from individual model limitations. Controlled mitigation experiments further show that prompt engineering alone cannot resolve the dominant pitfalls, whereas enriching the inter-agent communication protocol reduces communication-related failures by up to 15 percentage points. The pitfall taxonomy and diagnostic methodology developed in this work provide a foundation for designing more reliable autonomous agents for cloud RCA.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose Differential Reasoning Learning (DRL), a framework that improves clinical agents by learning from reasoning discrepancies. From reference reasoning rationales (e.g., physician-authored clinical rationale, clinical guidelines, or outputs from more capable models) and the agent's free-form chain-of-thought (CoT), DRL extracts reasoning graphs as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and performs a clinically weighted graph edit distance (GED)-based discrepancy analysis. An LLM-as-a-judge aligns semantically equivalent nodes and diagnoses discrepancies between graphs. These graph-level discrepancy diagnostics are converted into natural-language instructions and stored in a Differential Reasoning Knowledge Base (DR-KB). At inference, we retrieve top-$k$ instructions via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to augment the agent prompt and patch likely logic gaps. Evaluation on open medical question answering (QA) benchmarks and a Return Visit Admissions (RVA) prediction task from internal clinical data demonstrates gains over baselines, improving both final-answer accuracy and reasoning fidelity. Ablation studies confirm gains from infusing reference reasoning rationales and the top-$k$ retrieval strategy. Clinicians' review of the output provides further assurance of the approach. Together, results suggest that DRL supports more reliable clinical decision-making in complex reasoning scenarios and offers a practical mechanism for deployment under limited token budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce Early-Stopping for Token-Aware Reasoning (ESTAR), which detects and reduces such reasoning redundancy to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Our method combines (i) a trajectory-based classifier that identifies when reasoning can be safely stopped, (ii) supervised fine-tuning to teach LRMs to propose self-generated <stop> signals, and (iii) <stop>-aware reinforcement learning that truncates rollouts at self-generated stop points with compute-aware rewards. Experiments on four reasoning datasets show that ESTAR reduces reasoning length by about 3.7x (from 4,799 to 1,290) while preserving accuracy (74.9% vs. 74.2%), with strong cross-domain generalization.

This problem is exacerbated when a human user wishes to either guide or interact with the agent in natural language. Although the use of Language Models (LMs) is the default choice, as an AI tool, they struggle with tasks involving physics. The LM's capability for physical reasoning is learned from observational data, rather than being grounded in simulation. A common approach is to include simulation traces as context, but this suffers from poor scalability as simulation traces contain larger volumes of fine-grained numerical and semantic data. In this paper, we propose a natural language guided method to discover coarse-grained patterns (e.g., 'rigid-body collision', 'stable support', etc.) from detailed simulation logs. Specifically, we synthesize programs that operate on simulation logs and map them to a series of high level activated patterns. We show, through two physics benchmarks, that this annotated representation of the simulation log is more amenable to natural language reasoning about physical systems. We demonstrate how this method enables LMs to generate effective reward programs from goals specified in natural language, which may be used within the context of planning or supervised learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

When tackling a specific task, we do not rely on a single mindset; instead, we integrate multiple mindsets within the single solution process. However, existing LLM reasoning methods fall into a common trap: they apply the same fixed mindset across all steps, overlooking that different stages of solving the same problem require fundamentally different mindsets. This single-minded assumption prevents models from reaching the next level of intelligence. To address this limitation, we propose Chain of Mindset (CoM), a training-free agentic framework that enables step-level adaptive mindset orchestration. CoM decomposes reasoning into four functionally heterogeneous mindsets: Spatial, Convergent, Divergent, and Algorithmic. A Meta-Agent dynamically selects the optimal mindset based on the evolving reasoning state, while a bidirectional Context Gate filters cross-module information flow to maintain effectiveness and efficiency. Experiments across six challenging benchmarks spanning mathematics, code generation, scientific QA, and spatial reasoning demonstrate that CoM achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the strongest baseline by 4.96\\% and 4.72\\% in overall accuracy on Qwen3-VL-32B-Instruct and Gemini-2.0-Flash, while balancing reasoning efficiency.

While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average.

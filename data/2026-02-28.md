Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.

Abstract: Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation (GRAVE) has been shown to be a strong variant within the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) family of algorithms for General Game Playing (GGP). However, its reliance on storing additional win/visit statistics at each node makes its use impractical in memory-constrained environments, thereby limiting its applicability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the GRAVE2, GRAVER and GRAVER2 algorithms, which extend GRAVE through two-level search, node recycling, and a combination of both techniques, respectively. We show that these enhancements enable a drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of GRAVE.

In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $\u03b5$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u57fa\u5c3c\u6307\u6570\uff09\u548c\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6548\u7387\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u540e\u6709\u9650\u7269\u8d44\u7684\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8634%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u540e\u4eba\u9053\u4e3b\u4e49\u7269\u6d41\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u7269\u8d44\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u89c4\u5212\u8f66\u8f86\u8def\u5f84\uff08\u4ece\u914d\u9001\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5230\u907f\u96be\u6240\uff09\u5e76\u5408\u7406\u5206\u914d\u6551\u63f4\u7269\u8d44\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5e73\u8861\u914d\u9001\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff08\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\uff09\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u672a\u6ee1\u8db3\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u57fa\u4e8eGini\u6307\u6570\uff09\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u603b\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\uff08\u6548\u7387\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u89c4\u5212\uff08MIP\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528$\\epsilon$-\u7ea6\u675f\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u8d28\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u5206\u914d\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff08B&P\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\uff08B&P\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5546\u4e1aMIP\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6548\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5c06\u63f4\u52a9\u5206\u914d\u7684\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u964d\u4f4e34%\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u6781\u5bbd\u677e\u6216\u6781\u7d27\u5f20\u65f6\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u8986\u76d6\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u8bcd\u5178\u5e8f\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff1b\u800c\u5728\u4e2d\u7b49\u9650\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5206\u652f\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u707e\u540e\u7269\u8d44\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5206\u914d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7b49\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u707e\u540e\u7269\u6d41\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331.

In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method.

However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86S$^{3}$IT\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5ea7\u4f4d\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6574\u5408\u7269\u7406\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6587\u672c\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u80fd\u529b\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6574\u5408\u793e\u4ea4\u89c4\u8303\u548c\u7269\u7406\u9650\u5236\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u8131\u79bb\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5982\u6587\u672c\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u793e\u4ea4\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u5177\u8eab\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6743\u8861\u4e24\u7c7b\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86S$^{3}$IT\uff08Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test\uff09\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u8eab\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u8981\u6c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7fa4\u7531LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u5177\u6709\u590d\u6742\u4eba\u9645\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u504f\u597d\u7684NPC\u5b89\u6392\u5ea7\u4f4d\u7684\u201c\u5ea7\u4f4d\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u201d\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u8bdd\u83b7\u53d6\u504f\u597d\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a2\u7d22\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728S$^{3}$IT\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u5728\u6574\u5408\u5177\u8eab\u548c\u793e\u4ea4\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u8fd9\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86S$^{3}$IT\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5177\u8eab\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u5f25\u8865\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \\lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faLieflow\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u674e\u7fa4\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79bb\u6563\u7fa4\uff08\u5982\u53cd\u5c04\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u201c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u523b\u6536\u655b\u201d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd/\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u9879\u5e94\u7528\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u4e8b\u5148\u4e86\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\\lieflow\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u674e\u7fa4\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08flow matching\uff09\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53d1\u73b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u8986\u76d6\u8f83\u5927\u5047\u8bbe\u7fa4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6392\u5217\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u201c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u523b\u6536\u655b\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u57282D\u548c3D\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u7fa4\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u6570\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u674e\u7fa4\u4e0a\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08\\lieflow\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79bb\u6563\u7fa4\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u65b9\u6848\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSOF\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u8c61\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u5e76\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u4e60\u5f97\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u957f\u5468\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u679c\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f4e\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u800c\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5728\u5355\u6b65\u7ea7\u522b\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f25\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ca\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u901a\u7528\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u6280\u80fd\u62bd\u8c61\u201d\uff08SOF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5229\u7528**\u5149\u6d41**\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u6280\u80fd\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8be5\u5149\u6d41\u6355\u6349\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u90fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u80fd\uff0cSOF\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u884d\u751f\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u9ad8\u7ea7\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u5730\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSOF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728**\u591a\u4efb\u52a1**\u548c**\u957f\u5468\u671f**\uff08\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6d41\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u6280\u80fd\uff0cSOF\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f4e\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ca\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u65e0\u52a8\u4f5c\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7528\u4e8eLLM\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RL\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7b56\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e14\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u9ad8\u51fa\u591a\u8fbe100\u500d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9075\u5faaS\u578b\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5185\u5bb9\u5ba1\u6838\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u7528\u6237\u548cAI\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u6f5c\u529b\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u653f\u7b56\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u53d8\u4ee5\u53ca\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5c06LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u5230\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u96be\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u9879\u5173\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cdRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u201cLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u5224\u8005\u201d\u6846\u67b6\uff09\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u3001\u7b26\u5408\u653f\u7b56\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5ba1\u6838\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "RL\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6269\u5c55\u8868\u73b0\u51faS\u578b\uff08sigmoid-like\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5373\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001Rollouts\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u5e73\u7a33\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u9010\u6e10\u9971\u548c\u3002RL\u5728\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u653f\u7b56\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002RL\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u9ad8\u51fa\u591a\u8fbe100\u500d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u901a\u7528LLM\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e13\u4e1a\u7684\u3001\u4e0e\u653f\u7b56\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u7a00\u7f3a\u6216\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea7\u5ba1\u6838\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c24\u5176\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reason2Decide\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u8ba1\u5212\u91c7\u6837\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7406\u7531\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c0f40\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7406\u7531\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08CDSS\uff09\u9762\u4e34\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff08\u7406\u7531\uff09\u5fc5\u987b\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u201c\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u201d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa Reason2Decide\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u79bb\uff09\u3002\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff08Stage-1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7406\u7531\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff08Stage-2\uff09\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u7406\u7531\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u201c\u8ba1\u5212\u91c7\u6837\u201d\uff08scheduled sampling\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u4ece\u4f9d\u8d56\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u8f6c\u5411\u4f9d\u8d56\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e13\u6709\u7684\u5206\u8bca\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u516c\u5171\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u95ee\u7b54\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u3002Reason2Decide \u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff08F1\uff09\u548c\u7406\u7531\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff08BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u67d0\u4e9b\u96f6\u6837\u672cLLMs\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7406\u7531\u6765\u6e90\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7406\u7531\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c0f 40 \u500d\uff0c\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "Reason2Decide \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8ba1\u5212\u91c7\u6837\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7406\u7531\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5927\u5e45\u7f29\u5c0f\uff08\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5c0f 40 \u500d\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u6613\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated.

We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed \"thinking\" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open \"thinking\" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed \"thinking\" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives.

The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model.

Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u201c\u6570\u5b57\u535a\u5f08\u201d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\uff08\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\uff09\u4e14\u662f\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\uff0c\u800cLLM\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\u5e76\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u672c\u624d\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6570\u5b57\u535a\u5f08\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63a2\u7a76\u4e24\u8005\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u201c\u6570\u5b57\u535a\u5f08\u201d\u6982\u5ff5\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u4eba\u7c7b\u548cLLM\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u66f4\u52a0\u7075\u6d3b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u751a\u81f3\u4ece\u5355\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff09\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0cLLM\u66f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u6837\u672c\u624d\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6355\u6349\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9LLM\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6355\u6349\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \\textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u79bb\u7ebf\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PbRL\uff09\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u56e0\u663e\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 $\text{PreSa}$ (\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50) \u6846\u67b6\u3002$\text{PreSa}$ \u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168RLHF\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PbRL\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5de5\u7a0b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168RLHF\uff08\u5148\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u518d\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675fRL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa $\text{PreSa}$\uff08\u504f\u597d\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5(a) \u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u4ee5\u53ca\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u5b89\u5168\u6807\u7b7e\u6765\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u95f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b(b) \u5c06\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff1b(c) \u5728\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u8303\u5f0f\u5185\u6c42\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u9700\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5177\u6709\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c$\text{PreSa}$ \u6210\u529f\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "$\text{PreSa}$ \u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168RLHF\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents.

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.\n  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.\n  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \\emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.\n  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a Bohrium+SciMaster \u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u7f16\u6392\u5806\u6808\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u5c55\u201c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u79d1\u5b66\u201d\uff08Agentic Science\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u79d1\u5b66\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u96be\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u590d\u73b0\u3001\u8bb8\u591a\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u975e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53cb\u597d\u3001\u6267\u884c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f80\u5f80\u662f\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6765\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u79d1\u5b66\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 Bohrium+SciMaster \u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002Bohrium \u4f5c\u4e3a AI4S \u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u6258\u7ba1\u3001\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u754c\u7684 HuggingFace\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u8d44\u6e90\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002SciMaster \u8d1f\u8d23\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u80fd\u529b\u7f16\u6392\u6210\u957f\u5468\u671f\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7531\u4e00\u4e2a\u201c\u79d1\u5b66\u667a\u80fd\u57fa\u8d28\u201d\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5341\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u79d1\u5b66\u5468\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u5e76\u4ece\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u4ee5\u6267\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u5c55\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u79d1\u5b66\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u548c\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982 Bohrium+SciMaster\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u77ed\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u5468\u671f\u3002"}}

However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86LLMs\u548cSLMs\u5728\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC III\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5371\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u4f11\u514b\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1GatorTron Base\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u4f46LLMs\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\u5e76\u672a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9SLMs\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u672a\u6765LLM\u5e94\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5f7b\u5e95\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u53ca\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u4f11\u514b\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584\u5371\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u9884\u540e\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86MIMIC III\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d17,294\u6b21ICU\u4f4f\u9662\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7b5b\u9009\u51fa355\u4f8b\u6b63\u5e38\u4f11\u514b\u6307\u6570\u548c87\u4f8b\u5f02\u5e38\u4f11\u514b\u6307\u6570\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08GatorTron-Base\u3001Llama 8B\u3001Mistral 7B\uff09\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08BioBERT\u3001DocBERT\u3001Word2Vec\u7b49\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5371\u91cd\u75c7\u60a3\u8005\u4f11\u514b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Focal Loss\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u6765\u5904\u7406\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "GatorTron Base\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0880.5%\uff09\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u663e\u793a\uff0cLLMs\u548c\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u4f11\u514b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1LLMs\u5728\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u5e76\u4e0d\u4e00\u5b9a\u6bd4\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08SLMs\uff09\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u83b7\u5f97\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u5e94\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e34\u5e8a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u547d\u540d\u5b9e\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6216\u8868\u578b\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6559\u5e08\u60c5\u7eea\u5206\u6790\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6559\u5e08\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6T-MED\uff08\u5305\u542b\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684AAM-TSA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\u5bf9\u6559\u5b66\u6548\u7387\u3001\u5b66\u751f\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u7ee9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5f80\u5f80\u56e0\u6559\u5e08\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u8868\u6f14\u6027\uff08performative nature\uff09\u548c\u5ffd\u7565\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u7eea\u3002", "method": "(1) \u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6559\u5e08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u96c6T-MED\uff0814,938\u4e2a\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6K-12\u5230\u9ad8\u7b49\u6559\u80b2\u7684250\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u8bfe\u5802\uff09\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6807\u6ce8\u786e\u4fdd\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002(2) \u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6559\u5e08\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578bAAM-TSA\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u95e8\u63a7\u5355\u5143\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAAM-TSA\u6a21\u578b\u5728T-MED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u8fd8\u662f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5747\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6559\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6559\u5e08\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u6570\u636e\u96c6T-MED\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u7684AAM-TSA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6559\u5e08\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660eAAM-TSA\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002"}}

However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent.

However, recent work (Raghavan & Bareinboim, 2025) has formally characterized a family of counterfactual distributions which can be directly estimated via experimental methods - a notion they call $\\textit{counterfactual realizabilty}$. This leaves open the question of what $\\textit{additional}$ counterfactual quantities now become identifiable, given this new access to (some) Layer 3 data. To answer this question, we develop the CTFIDU+ algorithm for identifying counterfactual queries from an arbitrary set of Layer 3 distributions, and prove that it is complete for this task. Building on this, we establish the theoretical limit of which counterfactuals can be identified from physically realizable distributions, thus implying the $\\textit{fundamental limit to exact causal inference in the non-parametric setting}$. Finally, given the impossibility of identifying certain critical types of counterfactuals, we derive novel analytic bounds for such quantities using realizable counterfactual data, and corroborate using simulations that counterfactual data helps tighten the bounds for non-identifiable quantities in practice."}

In this work, we propose a theoretical framework for planning under partial observability using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) formulated using causal knowledge. By representing shifts in the environment as interventions on this causal POMDP, the framework enables evaluating plans under hypothesized changes and actively identifying which components of the environment have been altered. We show how to maintain and update a belief over both the latent state and the underlying domain, and we prove that the value function remains piecewise linear and convex (PWLC) in this augmented belief space. Preservation of PWLC under distribution shifts has the advantage of maintaining the tractability of planning via $α$-vector-based POMDP methods."}

In this paper, we address what's wrong with our conception of AGI, and why, even in its most coherent formulation, it is a flawed concept to describe the future of AI. We explore whether the most widely accepted definitions are plausible, useful, and truly general. We argue that AI must embrace specialization, rather than strive for generality, and in its specialization strive for superhuman performance, and introduce Superhuman Adaptable Intelligence (SAI). SAI is defined as intelligence that can learn to exceed humans at anything important that we can do, and that can fill in the skill gaps where humans are incapable. We then lay out how SAI can help hone a discussion around AI that was blurred by an overloaded definition of AGI, and extrapolate the implications of using it as a guide for the future."}

While effective for short tasks, these approaches often lead to redundant tool usage, unstable reasoning, and high token consumption in complex long-horizon tasks involving branching, iteration, or multi-tool coordination. To address these limitations, this paper introduces PseudoAct, a novel framework for flexible planning and action control in LLM agents through pseudocode synthesis. Leveraging the ability of LLMs to express task-solving strategies as code, PseudoAct synthesizes a structured pseudocode plan that decomposes a task into subtasks and explicitly encodes control flow, including sequencing, conditionals, loops, parallel composition, and combinations of these logic primitives. Actions are then executed by following this global plan, making the decision logic explicit and temporally coherent. This design reduces redundant actions, prevents infinite loops, and avoids uninformative alternative exploration, enabling consistent and efficient long-horizon decision-making. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing reactive agent approaches, achieving a 20.93% absolute gain in success rate on FEVER and setting a new state-of-the-art on HotpotQA."}

We propose ODAR-Expert, an adaptive routing framework that optimizes the accuracy-efficiency trade-off via principled resource allocation. ODAR uses a difficulty estimator grounded in amortized active inference to dynamically route queries between a heuristic Fast Agent and a deliberative Slow Agent. We further introduce a free-energy-principled, risk-sensitive fusion mechanism that selects answers by minimizing a variational free energy objective, balancing log-likelihood with epistemic uncertainty (varentropy) as a principled alternative to ad hoc voting over heterogeneous candidates. Extensive evaluation across 23 benchmarks shows strong and consistent gains, including 98.2% accuracy on MATH and 54.8% on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), while improving the compute-accuracy frontier under compute-matched settings. We also validate reproducibility on a fully open-source stack (Llama 4 + DeepSeek), where ODAR surpasses homogeneous sampling strategies while reducing computational costs by 82%. Overall, our results suggest that thinking-optimal scaling requires adaptive resource allocation with free-energy-based decision-making rather than simply increasing test-time compute."}

To address these challenges, we propose CHIEF, a novel framework that transforms chaotic trajectories into a structured hierarchical causal graph. It then employs hierarchical oracle-guided backtracking to efficiently prune the search space via sybthesized virtual oracles. Finally, it implements counterfactual attribution via a progressive causal screening strategy to rigorously distinguish true root causes from propagated symptoms.

The present paper describes the Auton Agentic AI Framework, a principled architecture for standardizing the creation, execution, and governance of autonomous agent systems. The framework is organized around a strict separation between the Cognitive Blueprint, a declarative, language-agnostic specification of agent identity and capabilities, and the Runtime Engine, the platform-specific execution substrate that instantiates and runs the agent. This separation enables cross-language portability, formal auditability, and modular tool integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The paper formalizes the agent execution model as an augmented Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) with a latent reasoning space, introduces a hierarchical memory consolidation architecture inspired by biological episodic memory systems, defines a constraint manifold formalism for safety enforcement via policy projection rather than post-hoc filtering, presents a three-level self-evolution framework spanning in-context adaptation through reinforcement learning, and describes runtime optimizations -- including parallel graph execution, speculative inference, and dynamic context pruning -- that reduce end-to-end latency for multi-step agent workflows."}

To this end, we systematically study the role of reasoning in DG using DomainBed-Reasoning, a newly constructed extension of DomainBed dataset, in which each sample is paired with class-relevant reasoning chains. Our analysis reveals two key challenges: (i) fine-tuning MLLMs with reasoning chains for classification is more challenging than direct label supervision, since the model must optimize complex reasoning sequences before label prediction; and (ii) mismatches in reasoning patterns between supervision signals and fine-tuned MLLMs lead to a trade-off between semantic richness (informative but harder to optimize) and optimization efficiency (easier to optimize but less informative). To address these issues, we propose RD-MLDG (Reasoning-Driven Multimodal LLM for Domain Generalization), a framework with two components: (i) MTCT (Multi-Task Cross-Training), which introduces an additional direct classification pathway to guide reasoning supervision; and (ii) SARR (Self-Aligned Reasoning Regularization), which preserves the semantic richness of reasoning chains while mitigating reasoning-pattern mismatches via iterative self-labeling.

This can enable governance based on materialized downstream effects rather than theoretical capabilities."}

A Preliminary Turing Test for Speech-to-Speech Interaction", "comment": "Accepted by ICLR 2026 Conference", "summary": "The pursuit of human-like conversational agents has long been guided by the Turing test. For modern speech-to-speech (S2S) systems, a critical yet unanswered question is whether they can converse like humans. To tackle this, we conduct the first Turing test for S2S systems, collecting 2,968 human judgments on dialogues between 9 state-of-the-art S2S systems and 28 human participants. Our results deliver a clear finding: no existing evaluated S2S system passes the test, revealing a significant gap in human-likeness. To diagnose this failure, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy of 18 human-likeness dimensions and crowd-annotate our collected dialogues accordingly. Our analysis shows that the bottleneck is not semantic understanding but stems from paralinguistic features, emotional expressivity, and conversational persona. Furthermore, we find that off-the-shelf AI models perform unreliably as Turing test judges. In response, we propose an interpretable model that leverages the fine-grained human-likeness ratings and delivers accurate and transparent human-vs-machine discrimination, offering a powerful tool for automatic human-likeness evaluation. Our work establishes the first human-likeness evaluation for S2S systems and moves beyond binary outcomes to enable detailed diagnostic insights, paving the way for human-like improvements in conversational AI systems."}

This study presents a novel, scalable bi-level optimization framework, validated on real operational data on UK strategic road networks (M25, M6, A1), including interconnected local road networks in surrounding areas for vehicle traversing, as part of the highway operator's efforts to solve existing planning challenges. At the upper level, a reinforcement learning (RL) agent strategically partitions the road network into manageable clusters and optimally allocates resources from multiple depots. At the lower level, a multi-objective vehicle routing problem (VRP) is solved within each cluster, minimizing the maximum vehicle travel time and total carbon emissions. Unlike existing approaches, our method handles large-scale, real-world networks efficiently, explicitly incorporating vehicle-specific constraints, depot capacities, and road segment requirements. Results demonstrate significant improvements, including balanced workloads, reduced maximum travel times below the targeted two-hour threshold, lower emissions, and substantial cost savings. This study illustrates how advanced AI-driven bi-level optimization can directly enhance operational decision-making in real-world transportation and logistics."}

Feedback and criticism is most welcome", "summary": "This paper presents the Artificial Agency Program (AAP), a position and research agenda for building AI systems as reality embedded, resource-bounded agents whose development is driven by curiosity-as-learning-progress under physical and computational constraints. The central thesis is that AI is most useful when treated as part of an extended human--tool system that increases sensing, understanding, and actuation capability while reducing friction at the interface between people, tools, and environments. The agenda unifies predictive compression, intrinsic motivation, empowerment and control, interface quality (unification), and language/self-communication as selective information bottlenecks. We formulate these ideas as a falsifiable program with explicit costs, staged experiments, and a concrete multimodal tokenized testbed in which an agent allocates limited budget among observation, action, and deliberation. The aim is to provide a conceptual and experimental framework that connects intrinsic motivation, information theory, thermodynamics, bounded rationality, and modern reasoning systems"}

However, standard outcome-based supervision suffers from a critical limitation that penalizes trajectories that are largely correct but fail due to several missteps as heavily as completely erroneous ones. This coarse feedback signal causes the model to discard valuable largely correct rollouts, leading to a degradation in rollout diversity that prematurely narrows the exploration space. Process Reward Models have demonstrated efficacy in providing reliable step-wise verification for test-time scaling, naively integrating these signals into RLVR as dense rewards proves ineffective.Prior methods attempt to introduce off-policy guided whole-trajectory replacement that often outside the policy model's distribution, but still fail to utilize the largely correct rollouts generated by the model itself and thus do not effectively mitigate the narrowing of the exploration space. To address these issues, we propose SCOPE (Step-wise Correction for On-Policy Exploration), a novel framework that utilizes Process Reward Models to pinpoint the first erroneous step in suboptimal rollouts and applies fine-grained, step-wise off-policy rectification. By applying precise refinement on partially correct rollout, our method effectively salvages partially correct trajectories and increases diversity score by 13.5%, thereby sustaining a broad exploration space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results, achieving an average accuracy of 46.6% on math reasoning and exhibiting robust generalization with 53.4% accuracy on out-of-distribution reasoning tasks."}

Existing benchmarks largely rely on static, hand-curated sets of contest or textbook-style problems as proxies for mathematical research. Instead, we establish an updatable benchmark evaluating models directly on the latest research results in mathematics. This consists of an automatic pipeline that extracts lemmas from arXiv and rewrites them into self-contained statements by making all assumptions and required definitions explicit. It results in a benchmark that can be updated regularly with new problems taken directly from human mathematical research, while previous instances can be used for training without compromising future evaluations. We benchmark current state-of-the-art LLMs, which obtain around 10-15$\\%$ accuracy in theorem proving (pass@1) depending on the model, showing that there is currently a large margin of progression for LLMs to reach human-level proving capabilities in a research context."}

To this end, we study an extended problem that is closer to practical scenarios--the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Limited Buffers and Material Kitting. In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated considerable potential in scheduling tasks. However, its capacity for state modeling remains limited when handling complex dependencies and long-term constraints. To address this, we leverage a heterogeneous graph network within the DRL framework to model the global state. By constructing efficient message passing among machines, operations, and buffers, the network focuses on avoiding decisions that may cause frequent pallet changes during long-sequence scheduling, thereby helping improve buffer utilization and overall decision quality. Experimental results on both synthetic and real production line datasets show that the proposed method outperforms traditional heuristics and advanced DRL methods in terms of makespan and pallet changes, and also achieves a good balance between solution quality and computational cost. Furthermore, a supplementary video is provided to showcase a simulation system that effectively visualizes the progression of the production line."}

Accurate uncertainty metrics could enable escalation of unreliable queries to human experts or larger models for improved performance. However, existing uncertainty metrics have practical constraints, such as being designed only for specific modalities, reliant on external tools, or computationally expensive. We introduce UMPIRE, a training-free uncertainty quantification framework for MLLMs that works efficiently across various input and output modalities without external tools, relying only on the models' own internal modality features. UMPIRE computes the incoherence-adjusted semantic volume of sampled MLLM responses for a given task instance, effectively capturing both the global semantic diversity of samples and the local incoherence of responses based on internal model confidence. We propose uncertainty desiderata for MLLMs and provide theoretical analysis motivating UMPIRE's design. Extensive experiments show that UMPIRE consistently outperforms baseline metrics in error detection and uncertainty calibration across image, audio, and video-text benchmarks, including adversarial and out-of-distribution settings. We also demonstrate UMPIRE's generalization to non-text output tasks, including image and audio generation."}

There are two major gaps in existing benchmarks: (i) the lack of standardized, process-aware evaluation that captures instruction adherence and process fidelity, and (ii) the scarcity of accurately labeled training data. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DARE-bench, a benchmark designed for machine learning modeling and data science instruction following. Unlike many existing benchmarks that rely on human- or model-based judges, all tasks in DARE-bench have verifiable ground truth, ensuring objective and reproducible evaluation. To cover a broad range of tasks and support agentic tools, DARE-bench consists of 6,300 Kaggle-derived tasks and provides both large-scale training data and evaluation sets. Extensive evaluations show that even highly capable models such as gpt-o4-mini struggle to achieve good performance, especially in machine learning modeling tasks. Using DARE-bench training tasks for fine-tuning can substantially improve model performance. For example, supervised fine-tuning boosts Qwen3-32B's accuracy by 1.83x and reinforcement learning boosts Qwen3-4B's accuracy by more than 8x. These significant improvements verify the importance of DARE-bench both as an accurate evaluation benchmark and critical training data."}

Many prompting techniques have been developed to assist with LLM reasoning, notably Chain-of-Thought (CoT); however, these techniques, too, have come under scrutiny as LLMs' ability to reason at all has come into question. Borrowing from the domain of cognitive and educational science, this paper investigates whether the Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) framework can improve LLM reasoning capabilities beyond its previously demonstrated success in educational applications. The TMK framework's unique ability to capture causal, teleological, and hierarchical reasoning structures, combined with its explicit task decomposition mechanisms, makes it particularly well-suited for addressing language model reasoning deficiencies, and unlike other hierarchical frameworks such as HTN and BDI, TMK provides explicit representations of not just what to do and how to do it, but also why actions are taken. The study evaluates TMK by experimenting on the PlanBench benchmark, focusing on the Blocksworld domain to test for reasoning and planning capabilities, examining whether TMK-structured prompting can help language models better decompose complex planning problems into manageable sub-tasks. Results also highlight significant performance inversion in reasoning models. TMK prompting enables the reasoning model to achieve up to an accuracy of 97.3\\% on opaque, symbolic tasks (Random versions of Blocksworld in PlanBench) where it previously failed (31.5\\%), suggesting the potential to bridge the gap between semantic approximation and symbolic manipulation. Our findings suggest that TMK functions not merely as context, but also as a mechanism that steers reasoning models away from their default linguistic modes to engage formal, code-execution pathways in the context of the experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1-\u65b9\u6cd5-\u77e5\u8bc6(TMK)\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u5426\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728PlanBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684Blocksworld\u57df\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c,\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aTMK\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece31.5%\u63d0\u5347\u81f397.3%,\u8868\u660eTMK\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587,\u8fd8\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5411\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be,\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f(\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u94feCoT)\u4e5f\u53d7\u5230\u8d28\u7591\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5e0c\u671b\u501f\u9274\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u79d1\u5b66\u9886\u57df\u7684TMK\u6846\u67b6,\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6355\u6349\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u76ee\u7684\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u80fd\u529b,\u4ee5\u53ca\u663e\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u673a\u5236,\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\u3002TMK\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u505a\u4ec0\u4e48\u548c\u600e\u4e48\u505a,\u8fd8\u80fd\u8bf4\u660e\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u8fd9\u6837\u505a,\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5176\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u6539\u5584\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528TMK\u6846\u67b6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5,\u5728PlanBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30,\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8Blocksworld\u9886\u57df\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7TMK\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5e2e\u52a9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1,\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "TMK\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Blocksworld\u7684\u968f\u673a\u7248\u672c(\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\u7b26\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1)\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c,\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece31.5%\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u81f397.3%\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fd8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u53cd\u8f6c\u73b0\u8c61,\u8868\u660eTMK\u80fd\u591f\u5f25\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0TMK\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u53d1\u6325\u4f5c\u7528,\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236,\u80fd\u591f\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u5f0f\u8f6c\u5411\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def,\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6539\u8fdbAI\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Although recent advances in multi-agent LLM-based systems have enhanced their mathematical reasoning capabilities, they still lack a reliably revisable representation of the reasoning process. Existing agents either operate in rigid sequential pipelines that cannot correct earlier steps or rely on heuristic self-evaluation that can fail to identify and fix errors. In addition, programmatic context can distract language models and degrade accuracy. To address these gaps, we introduce Iteratively Improved Program Construction (IIPC), a reasoning method that iteratively refines programmatic reasoning chains and combines execution feedback with the native Chain-of-thought abilities of the base LLM to maintain high-level contextual focus.

This paper proposes AgentArk, a novel framework to distill multi-agent dynamics into the weights of a single model, effectively transforming explicit test-time interactions into implicit model capabilities. This equips a single agent with the intelligence of multi-agent systems while remaining computationally efficient. Specifically, we investigate three hierarchical distillation strategies across various models, tasks, scaling, and scenarios: reasoning-enhanced fine-tuning; trajectory-based augmentation; and process-aware distillation. By shifting the burden of computation from inference to training, the distilled models preserve the efficiency of one agent while exhibiting strong reasoning and self-correction performance of multiple agents. They further demonstrate enhanced robustness and generalization across diverse reasoning tasks. We hope this work can shed light on future research on efficient and robust multi-agent development.

Learned world models can cheaply predict missing facts, but prediction errors can silently induce infeasible commitments. We present \\textbf{Active Epistemic Control (AEC)}, an epistemic-categorical planning layer that integrates model-based belief management with categorical feasibility checks. AEC maintains a strict separation between a \\emph{grounded fact store} used for commitment and a \\emph{belief store} used only for pruning candidate plans. At each step, it either queries the environment to ground an unresolved predicate when uncertainty is high or predictions are ambiguous, or simulates the predicate to filter hypotheses when confidence is sufficient. Final commitment is gated by grounded precondition coverage and an SQ-BCP pullback-style compatibility check, so simulated beliefs affect efficiency but cannot directly certify feasibility. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld show that AEC achieves competitive success with fewer replanning rounds than strong LLM-agent baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent work has reported that monitorability--the degree to which CoT faithfully and informatively reflects internal computation--can appear as a \"free gift\" during the early stages of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We make this observation concrete through a systematic evaluation across model families and training domains. Our results show that this effect is not universal: monitorability improvements are strongly data-dependent. In particular, we demonstrate the critical role of data diversity and instruction-following data during RLVR training. We further show that monitorability is orthogonal to capability--improvements in reasoning performance do not imply increased transparency. Through mechanistic analysis, we attribute monitorability gains primarily to response distribution sharpening (entropy reduction) and increased attention to the prompt, rather than stronger causal reliance on reasoning traces. We also reveal how monitorability dynamics vary with controlled training and evaluation difficulty. Together, these findings provide a holistic view of how monitorability emerges under RLVR, clarifying when gains are likely to occur and when they are not.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet modern AI systems increasingly operate within human decision loops, where users interpret and act on model recommendations. Large Language Models generate fluent natural-language explanations that shape how users perceive and trust AI outputs, revealing a new attack surface at the cognitive layer: the communication channel between AI and its users. We introduce adversarial explanation attacks (AEAs), where an attacker manipulates the framing of LLM-generated explanations to modulate human trust in incorrect outputs. We formalize this behavioral threat through the trust miscalibration gap, a metric that captures the difference in human trust between correct and incorrect outputs under adversarial explanations. By incorporating this gap, AEAs explore the daunting threats in which persuasive explanations reinforce users' trust in incorrect predictions. To characterize this threat, we conducted a controlled experiment (n = 205), systematically varying four dimensions of explanation framing: reasoning mode, evidence type, communication style, and presentation format. Our findings show that users report nearly identical trust for adversarial and benign explanations, with adversarial explanations preserving the vast majority of benign trust despite being incorrect. The most vulnerable cases arise when AEAs closely resemble expert communication, combining authoritative evidence, neutral tone, and domain-appropriate reasoning. Vulnerability is highest on hard tasks, in fact-driven domains, and among participants who are less formally educated, younger, or highly trusting of AI. This is the first systematic security study that treats explanations as an adversarial cognitive channel and quantifies their impact on human trust in AI-assisted decision making.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Counterfactuals have emerged as one of the most compelling forms of explanation. They address ``why not'' questions by revealing how decisions could be altered. Despite the growing literature, most existing explainers focus on a single type of counterfactual and are restricted to local explanations, focusing on individual instances. There has been no systematic study of alternative counterfactual types, nor of global counterfactuals that shed light on a system's overall reasoning process.\n  This paper addresses the two gaps by introducing an axiomatic framework built on a set of desirable properties for counterfactual explainers. It proves impossibility theorems showing that no single explainer can satisfy certain axiom combinations simultaneously, and fully characterizes all compatible sets. Representation theorems then establish five one-to-one correspondences between specific subsets of axioms and the families of explainers that satisfy them. Each family gives rise to a distinct type of counterfactual explanation, uncovering five fundamentally different types of counterfactuals. Some of these correspond to local explanations, while others capture global explanations. Finally, the framework situates existing explainers within this taxonomy, formally characterizes their behavior, and analyzes the computational complexity of generating such explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, many real-world decision-making tasks are inherently online: crucial information must be acquired through interaction, feedback is delayed, and effective behavior requires balancing information collection and exploitation over time. While in-context learning enables adaptation without weight updates, existing LLMs often struggle to reliably leverage in-context interaction experience in such settings. In this work, we show that this limitation can be addressed through training. We introduce ORBIT, a multi-task, multi-episode meta-reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs to learn from interaction in context.

However, existing studies treat the entire interaction trajectories equally, overlooking the thought necessity and observation utility varies across turns. To this end, we first conduct quantitative investigations into how thought and observation affect agent effectiveness and efficiency. Based on our findings, we propose Agent-Omit, a unified training framework that empowers LLM agents to adaptively omit redundant thoughts and observations. Specifically, we first synthesize a small amount of cold-start data, including both single-turn and multi-turn omission scenarios, to fine-tune the agent for omission behaviors. Furthermore, we introduce an omit-aware agentic reinforcement learning approach, incorporating a dual sampling mechanism and a tailored omission reward to incentivize the agent's adaptive omission capability. Theoretically, we prove that the deviation of our omission policy is upper-bounded by KL-divergence. Experimental results on five agent benchmarks show that our constructed Agent-Omit-8B could obtain performance comparable to seven frontier LLM agent, and achieve the best effectiveness-efficiency trade-off than seven efficient LLM agents methods.

Rather than following a fixed pipeline, ReThinker dynamically allocates computation based on model confidence, enabling adaptive tool invocation, guided multi-dimensional reflection, and robust confidence-weighted selection. To support scalable training without human annotation, we further propose a reverse data synthesis pipeline and an adaptive trajectory recycling strategy that transform successful reasoning traces into high-quality supervision.

Our framework captures several intricacies of such a collaboration, including non-monetary exchanges, asymmetric information, and incentive misalignment. We bring the framework to life through comprehensive, data-driven simulations using real Stack Exchange data and commonly used LLMs. We demonstrate the incentive misalignment empirically, yet show that players can achieve roughly half of the utility in an ideal full-information scenario.

Despite significant leaps in visual fidelity, this approach has encountered a ``usability ceiling'' manifested as the Intent-Execution Gap (i.e., the fundamental disparity between a creator's high-level intent and the stochastic, black-box nature of current single-shot models). In this paper, inspired by the Vibe Coding, we introduce the \\textbf{Vibe AIGC}, a new paradigm for content generation via agentic orchestration, which represents the autonomous synthesis of hierarchical multi-agent workflows.\n  Under this paradigm, the user's role transcends traditional prompt engineering, evolving into a Commander who provides a Vibe, a high-level representation encompassing aesthetic preferences, functional logic, and etc. A centralized Meta-Planner then functions as a system architect, deconstructing this ``Vibe'' into executable, verifiable, and adaptive agentic pipelines. By transitioning from stochastic inference to logical orchestration, Vibe AIGC bridges the gap between human imagination and machine execution. We contend that this shift will redefine the human-AI collaborative economy, transforming AI from a fragile inference engine into a robust system-level engineering partner that democratizes the creation of complex, long-horizon digital assets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Vibe AIGC\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u6392\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5c06\u7528\u6237\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e08\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u6307\u6325\u5b98\uff0c\u7531\u5143\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5c06\u9ad8\u5c42\"\u6c1b\u56f4\"\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f25\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u60f3\u8c61\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u610f\u56fe-\u6267\u884c\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u9762\u4e34\"\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u5929\u82b1\u677f\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u610f\u56fe-\u6267\u884c\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff08Intent-Execution Gap\uff09\u2014\u2014\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6b21\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u3001\u9ed1\u76d2\u7279\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u5df2\u9047\u5230\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u5468\u671f\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u521b\u4f5c\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVibe AIGC\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f16\u6392\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7528\u6237\u4f5c\u4e3a\"\u6307\u6325\u5b98\"\u63d0\u4f9bVibe\uff08\u5305\u542b\u7f8e\u5b66\u504f\u597d\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u8868\u5f81\uff09\uff0c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5143\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff08Meta-Planner\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\uff0c\u5c06Vibe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ba1\u9053\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u968f\u673a\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u903b\u8f91\u7f16\u6392\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u610f\u56fe\u5230\u6267\u884c\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8f6c\u5316\u3002", "result": "Vibe AIGC\u8303\u5f0f\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u4eba\u7c7b\u60f3\u8c61\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u6267\u884c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u5c06AI\u4ece\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u5de5\u7a0b\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\uff0c\u4f7f\u590d\u6742\u3001\u957f\u5468\u671f\u6570\u5b57\u8d44\u4ea7\u7684\u521b\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6c11\u4e3b\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "Vibe AIGC\u8303\u5f0f\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4ece\u4ee5\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8f6c\u5411\u4ee5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7f16\u6392\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u8f6c\u53d8\u5c06\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7ecf\u6d4e\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6267\u884c\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u4ece\u5355\u6b21\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u5316\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b9e\u8df5\u6f14\u8fdb\u3002"}}

However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Reported studies demonstrate competence on various tasks ranging from EHR analysis and differential diagnosis to treatment planning and research workflows. Yet the literature largely consists of overviews which are either broad surveys or narrow dives into a single capability (e.g., memory, planning, reasoning), leaving healthcare work without a common frame. We address this by reviewing 49 studies using a seven-dimensional taxonomy: Cognitive Capabilities, Knowledge Management, Interaction Patterns, Adaptation & Learning, Safety & Ethics, Framework Typology and Core Tasks & Subtasks with 29 operational sub-dimensions. Using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria and a labeling rubric (Fully Implemented, Partially Implemented, Not Implemented), we map each study to the taxonomy and report quantitative summaries of capability prevalence and co-occurrence patterns. Our empirical analysis surfaces clear asymmetries. For instance, the External Knowledge Integration sub-dimension under Knowledge Management is commonly realized (~76% Fully Implemented) whereas Event-Triggered Activation sub-dimenison under Interaction Patterns is largely absent (~92% Not Implemented) and Drift Detection & Mitigation sub-dimension under Adaptation & Learning is rare (~98% Not Implemented). Architecturally, Multi-Agent Design sub-dimension under Framework Typology is the dominant pattern (~82% Fully Implemented) while orchestration layers remain mostly partial. Across Core Tasks & Subtasks, information centric capabilities lead e.g., Medical Question Answering & Decision Support and Benchmarking & Simulation, while action and discovery oriented areas such as Treatment Planning & Prescription still show substantial gaps (~59% Not Implemented).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The Model Evaluation & Threat Research (METR) report argues that AI capabilities have exhibited exponential growth since 2019. In this note, we argue that the data does not support exponential growth, even in shorter-term horizons. Whereas the METR study claims that fitting sigmoid/logistic curves results in inflection points far in the future, we fit a sigmoid curve to their current data and find that the inflection point has already passed. In addition, we propose a more complex model that decomposes AI capabilities into base and reasoning capabilities, exhibiting individual rates of improvement. We prove that this model supports our hypothesis that AI capabilities will exhibit an inflection point in the near future. Our goal is not to establish a rigorous forecast of our own, but to highlight the fragility of existing forecasts of exponential growth.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss.

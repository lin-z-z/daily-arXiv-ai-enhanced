AI intelligence is likely to be strange intelligence, defying familiar patterns of ability and inability, combining superhuman capacities in some domains with subhuman performance in other domains, and even within domains sometimes combining superhuman insight with surprising errors that few humans would make. We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which \"general intelligence\" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u4e86AI\u8fdb\u6b65\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b,\u63d0\u51fa\"\u719f\u6089\u667a\u80fd\"\u548c\"\u964c\u751f\u667a\u80fd\"\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5,\u8ba4\u4e3aAI\u667a\u80fd\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7684\"\u964c\u751f\u667a\u80fd\",\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u4eba\u548c\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u80fd\u529b,\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u89c2\u70b9\u5bf9AI\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ebf\u6027AI\u8fdb\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0AI\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u7279\u5f81\u3002AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u8d85\u4eba\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6,\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u751a\u81f3\u540c\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u5185\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u4f4e\u7ea7\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3AI\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u975e\u7edf\u4e00\u6027\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027,\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\"\u719f\u6089\u667a\u80fd\"(familiar intelligence)\u548c\"\u964c\u751f\u667a\u80fd\"(strange intelligence)\u4e24\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u533a\u5206\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u548cAI\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b,\u5c06\"\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\"\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5728\u5e7f\u6cdb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u80fd\u529b,\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u7ebf\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bba\u8bc1\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u6790\u6765\u652f\u6301\u8fd9\u4e00\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b,\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AI\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81:AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f1a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u5747\u8861\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u5e03,\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u4f1a\u5728\u770b\u4f3c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25,\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u4eba\u6c34\u5e73\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\"\u964c\u751f\u667a\u80fd\"\u6a21\u5f0f\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u7ebf\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e,\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1(\u5982IQ\u6d4b\u8bd5)\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u80fd\u63a8\u65ad\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u88ab\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\"\u964c\u751f\u667a\u80fd\",\u5177\u6709\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u65f6,\u4e0d\u80fd\u4ec5\u51ed\u4e2a\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u5c31\u5426\u5b9a\u5176\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73,\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u56e0\u67d0\u4e00\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\u5c31\u5047\u8bbe\u5176\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42\u6211\u4eec\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003AI\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5,\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e94\u8003\u8651\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u672c\u8d28,\u907f\u514d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated.

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.\n  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.\n  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting \"interactivity\" of actions. From this perspective, we outline a conceptual framework to provide actionable guidance for designing UQ in LLM agent setups. Finally, we conclude with practical implications of the agent UQ in frontier LLM development and domain-specific applications, as well as open remaining problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.\n  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.\n  The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.\n  This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\uff08ADR\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u907f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u536b\u661f\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u7684\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08PPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f68\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u788e\u7247\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u5728\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5728\u8f68\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c0f\u536b\u661f\u56e0\u5176\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u548c\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u800c\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u88ab\u91c7\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u788e\u7247\u4ea4\u4f1a\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u52a0\u6cb9\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u907f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u822a\u5929\u5668\u4ea4\u4f1a\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u8fd1\u7aef\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08masked PPO\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u52a0\u6cb9\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u907f\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f68\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\u5305\u62ec\u71c3\u6599\u6548\u7387\u3001\u907f\u514d\u6d3b\u8dc3\u78b0\u649e\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u9053\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b66\u4e60\u786e\u5b9a\u4e0e\u591a\u4e2a\u788e\u7247\u76ee\u6807\u4ea4\u4f1a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u71c3\u6599\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7eb3\u5165\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u52a0\u6cb9\u505c\u9760\u70b9\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6e90\u81eaIridium 33\u788e\u7247\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6a21\u62dfADR\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u788e\u7247\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u788e\u7247\u5206\u5e03\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u89c4\u5212\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u788e\u7247\u4e3b\u52a8\u6e05\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u788e\u7247\u6e05\u9664\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4ea4\u4f1a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health. Further research will address VERA-MH generalizability and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time.

We present GAMMS (Graph based Adversarial Multiagent Modeling Simulator), a lightweight yet extensible simulation framework designed to support fast development and evaluation of agent behavior in environments that can be represented as graphs. GAMMS emphasizes five core objectives: scalability, ease of use, integration-first architecture, fast visualization feedback, and real-world grounding. It enables efficient simulation of complex domains such as urban road networks and communication systems, supports integration with external tools (e.g., machine learning libraries, planning solvers), and provides built-in visualization with minimal configuration. GAMMS is agnostic to policy type, supporting heuristic, optimization-based, and learning-based agents, including those using large language models. By lowering the barrier to entry for researchers and enabling high-performance simulations on standard hardware, GAMMS facilitates experimentation and innovation in multi-agent systems, autonomous planning, and adversarial modeling.

Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6c11\u4e3b\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(DemPO)\u6846\u67b6,\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u6cd5\u62bd\u7b7e\u673a\u5236\u6784\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u6837\u672c,\u7528\u4e8eAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bad\u7ec3,\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709RLHF\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5(\u5982RLHF)\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7,\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4fbf\u5229\u6837\u672c,\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4ee3\u8868\u67d0\u4e9b\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u800c\u4f4e\u4f30\u5176\u4ed6\u7fa4\u4f53,\u5bfc\u81f4AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u591f\u53cd\u6620\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u548c\u66f4\u5177\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u7fa4\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDemPO\u6846\u67b6,\u5e94\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u62bd\u7b7e\u673a\u5236(\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u516c\u6c11\u8bae\u4f1a\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u673a\u5236)\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848:1)\u786c\u9762\u677f(Hard Panel):\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u7b7e\u62bd\u6837\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u914d\u989d\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u516c\u4f17\u6837\u672c\u7684\u504f\u597d\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3;2)\u8f6f\u9762\u677f(Soft Panel):\u4fdd\u7559\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u5728\u62bd\u7b7e\u4e2d\u7684\u7eb3\u5165\u6982\u7387\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8f6f\u9762\u677f\u52a0\u6743\u80fd\u591f\u4ee5\u95ed\u5f0f\u5f62\u5f0f\u6062\u590d\u9884\u671f\u7684\u786c\u9762\u677f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\u4e0e\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u516c\u5171\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6,\u4ee5\u53ca\u4ece\u7f8e\u56fd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9762\u677f\u72ec\u7acb\u83b7\u5f97\u768475\u6761\u5baa\u6cd5\u6761\u6b3e,\u5bf910\u4ebf\u523080\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684Llama\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d,\u786c\u9762\u677f\u59cb\u7ec8\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00,\u8f6f\u9762\u677f\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u52a0\u6743\u57fa\u7ebf,\u4e14\u6548\u5e94\u91cf\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u589e\u957f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u5728\u504f\u597d\u6536\u96c6\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4ee3\u8868\u6027,\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u540e\u4fee\u6b63,\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u53cd\u6620\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u516c\u4f17\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684AI\u6a21\u578b\u3002DemPO\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u6c11\u4e3b\u548c\u66f4\u5177\u5305\u5bb9\u6027\u7684AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

However, existing benchmarks often assume idealized communication between agents, limiting our ability to diagnose whether LLMs can maintain and repair interactions in more realistic, imperfect settings. To close this gap, we present \\textsc{SocialVeil}, a social learning environment that can simulate social interaction under cognitive-difference-induced communication barriers. Grounded in a systematic literature review of communication challenges in human interaction, \\textsc{SocialVeil} introduces three representative types of such disruption, \\emph{semantic vagueness}, \\emph{sociocultural mismatch}, and \\emph{emotional interference}. We also introduce two barrier-aware evaluation metrics, \\emph{unresolved confusion} and \\emph{mutual understanding}, to evaluate interaction quality under impaired communication. Experiments across 720 scenarios and four frontier LLMs show that barriers consistently impair performance, with mutual understanding reduced by over 45\\% on average, and confusion elevated by nearly 50\\%. Human evaluations validate the fidelity of these simulated barriers (ICC$\\approx$0.78, Pearson r$\\approx$0.80). We further demonstrate that adaptation strategies (Repair Instruction and Interactive learning) only have a modest effect far from barrier-free performance. This work takes a step toward bringing social interaction environments closer to real-world communication, opening opportunities for exploring the social intelligence of LLM agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SocialVeil\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u969c\u788d\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u3001\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4ea4\u6d41\u969c\u788d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86LLMs\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5f80\u5f80\u5047\u8bbe\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u60f3\u5316\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bca\u65adLLMs\u5728\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u7ef4\u6301\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd,\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u6d41\u4e2d\u8ba4\u77e5\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u969c\u788d\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u4ea4\u6d41\u6311\u6218\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0,\u6784\u5efa\u4e86SocialVeil\u793e\u4f1a\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883,\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u4ea4\u6d41\u969c\u788d\u7c7b\u578b:\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u6587\u5316\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u969c\u788d\u611f\u77e5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807:\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u5ea6\u3002\u5728720\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbfLLMs\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c,\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u62df\u969c\u788d\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4fee\u590d\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4ea4\u6d41\u969c\u788d\u6301\u7eed\u635f\u5bb3LLMs\u7684\u8868\u73b0,\u76f8\u4e92\u7406\u89e3\u5ea6\u5e73\u5747\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc745%,\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u8fd150%\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u969c\u788d\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6(ICC\u22480.78, Pearson r\u22480.80)\u3002\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565(\u4fee\u590d\u6307\u4ee4\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60)\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u5ea6\u6548\u679c,\u8fdc\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "SocialVeil\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u6d41\u7684\u73af\u5883,\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dLLMs\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4ea4\u6d41\u969c\u788d\u65f6\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650,\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u4ea4\u6d41\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u80fd\u529b,\u4e3a\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u667a\u80fd\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics. Our work establishes a principled foundation for structured, scalable, and causally grounded RAG systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In Chinese Tibetan medicine, encyclopedia entries are often dense and easy to match, which can dominate retrieval even when classics or clinical papers provide more authoritative evidence. We study a practical setting with three KBs (encyclopedia, classics, and clinical papers) and a 500-query benchmark (cutoff $K{=}5$) covering both single-KB and cross-KB questions. We propose two complementary methods to improve traceability, reduce hallucinations, and enable cross-KB verification. First, DAKS performs KB routing and budgeted retrieval to mitigate density-driven bias and to prioritize authoritative sources when appropriate.

In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \\emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \\emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \\emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\\%, 11.25\\%, and 9.55\\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning.

However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning.

We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks.

When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths.

Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision.

Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86THOR\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8d85\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95f4\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5185\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0cTHOR\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u572812\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8666.1%\u300155.9%\u548c20.4%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u8d85\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u76f4\u63a8\u5f0f\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u5185\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65b0\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "THOR\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u8d85\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5b9e\u4f53\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u95f4\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5185\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5e76\u884c\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e00\u4e2aTransformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u56fe\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cTHOR\u5728\u8d85\u5173\u7cfb\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u534a\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e8666.1%\u300155.9%\u548c20.4%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u6355\u83b7\u53ef\u8de8\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "THOR\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d85\u5173\u7cfb\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u4e2d\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u5f0f\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u5177\u4f53\u8bcd\u6c47\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002"}}

Supplementary material is included at the end of the main paper (16 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables)", "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories. Additionally, a progressive model-in-the-loop training strategy is introduced to improve the success rate of data mining. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the GUI agent fine-tuned using our mined data achieves state-of-the-art performance on several commonly used mobile GUI benchmarks. Our work will be released to facilitate the community research.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faM\u00b2-Miner,\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u6846\u67b6,\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u56de\u6536\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u3001\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898,\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e(\u610f\u56fe-\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9)\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3,\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u5927\u6311\u6218:\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e14\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6316\u6398\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faM\u00b2-Miner\u6846\u67b6,\u57fa\u4e8e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22(MCTS)\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec:(1)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u534f\u4f5c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6,\u7531InferAgent(\u63a8\u7406\u6307\u5bfc)\u3001OrchestraAgent(\u52a0\u901f\u6267\u884c)\u548cJudgeAgent(\u8bc4\u4f30\u5224\u65ad)\u7ec4\u6210;(2)\u8bbe\u8ba1\u610f\u56fe\u56de\u6536\u7b56\u7565,\u4ece\u6316\u6398\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u989d\u5916\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u4e30\u5bcc\u610f\u56fe\u591a\u6837\u6027;(3)\u5f15\u5165\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565,\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u79fb\u52a8GUI\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a,\u4f7f\u7528\u6316\u6398\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb(state-of-the-art)\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0,\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u6548\u7387\u3001\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "M\u00b2-Miner\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898,\u901a\u8fc7MCTS\u548c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6316\u6398\u3002\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u533a\u7814\u7a76,\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore.

Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces. Extensive experiments conducted across customized clustering, customized classification, and customized retrieval tasks demonstrate that OD-CRL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with superior generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \\textbf{ALIVE} (\\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \\emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent.

Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states.

Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors.

Inspired by how humans solve Tangram puzzles through trial-and-error, observation, and correction, we design a framework that models these human cognitive mechanisms. However, comprehensive experiments across five representative Vision-Language Models (VLMs) reveal systematic failures in continuous geometric reasoning: average IoU of only 0.41 on single-piece tasks, dropping to 0.23 on two-piece composition, far below human performance where children can complete Tangram tasks successfully. This paper addresses a fundamental challenge in self-improving AI: can models iteratively refine their predictions at test time without parameter updates? We introduce a test-time self-refinement framework that combines in-context learning (ICL) with reward-guided feedback loops, inspired by human cognitive processes. Our training-free verifier-refiner agent applies recursive refinement loops that iteratively self-refine predictions based on geometric consistency feedback, achieving IoU improvements from 0.63 to 0.932 on medium-triangle cases without any model retraining. This demonstrates that incorporating human-inspired iterative refinement mechanisms through ICL and reward loops can substantially enhance geometric reasoning in VLMs, moving self-improving AI from promise to practice in continuous spatial domains.

This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems.

However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

However, we identify a systemic pathology termed Recursive Space Contraction (RSC), an irreversible collapse driven by the combined dynamics of positive sharpening and negative squeezing, where the sampling probability of valid alternatives vanishes. While Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization aims to mitigate this, it imposes a rigid Shape Matching constraint that forces the policy to mimic the reference model's full density, creating a gradient conflict with the sharpening required for correctness. We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches. Empirical evaluations on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that APO breaks the accuracy-diversity trade-off, significantly improving Pass@1 while restoring the Pass@K diversity typically lost by standard policy gradient methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model.

Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via \"Effective-vs-Redundant\" neuron transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences.

Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy.

Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one.

Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous \"separation of concerns\" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented \"victim modeling\" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Series ISSN: 2195-2817", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly become familiar tools to researchers and practitioners. Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large.

However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

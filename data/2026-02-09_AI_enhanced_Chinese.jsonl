Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \\sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64.

In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities.

Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks.

Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness.

While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential.

Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges.

We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).\n  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions.

Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses.

Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AgentCPM-Report\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u672c\u5730\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u75288B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u548c\"\u5199\u4f5c\u5373\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\"(WARP)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u8ba2\u5927\u7eb2\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u7684\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\"\u5148\u89c4\u5212\u540e\u5199\u4f5c\"\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u521d\u59cb\u5927\u7eb2\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u9762\u5927\u7eb2\u672c\u8eab\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u51e0\u4e4e\u5b8c\u5168\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ed\u6e90\u6216\u5728\u7ebf\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u969c\u788d\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u672c\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAgentCPM-Report\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a(1) \u5199\u4f5c\u5373\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565(WARP)\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5728\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u8ba2\u5927\u7eb2\uff1b(2) \u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u8d77\u8349\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5171\u540c\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cbe\u70bc\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5927\u7eb2\u6f14\u5316\uff1b(3) \u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u3001\u539f\u5b50\u6280\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u6d41\u7a0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u8d4b\u4e88\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepResearch Bench\u3001DeepConsult\u548cDeepResearch Gym\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cAgentCPM-Report\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u7684\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b(Insight)\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "AgentCPM-Report\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7(8B\u53c2\u6570)\u7684\u672c\u5730\u6df1\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u5199\u4f5c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u95ed\u6e90\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9690\u79c1\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u95ed\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.\n  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.\n  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.\n  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency.

We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting \"safe\" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that \"confirmation bias\" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u4e2d\u4e3b\u52a8\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u671f\u671b\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca(EIG)\u7684\u7406\u6027\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565(PTS)\u867d\u7136\u4fe1\u606f\u6b21\u4f18\u4f46\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\"\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u8bef\"\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7406\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e3b\u52a8\u7684\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u9700\u8981\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u7406\u6027\u7684EIG\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684PTS\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u53ca\u5176\u80cc\u540e\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u7531\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\uff1a(1)\u7406\u6027\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u8005(Rational Active Learner)\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u671f\u671b\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca(EIG)\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b(2)\u6b63\u5411\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565(PTS)\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3a\u6b63\u4f8b\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u3002\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u6e38\u620f(Number Game)\u6982\u5ff5\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cEIG\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u9700\u8981\u8bc1\u4f2a\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u590d\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u6216\u5305\u542b\u4f8b\u5916\u7684\u89c4\u5219\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8eEIG\u7b56\u7565\u4e0eLLM\u63d0\u8bae\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u67e5\u8be2\u5c06\u540e\u9a8c\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u5411\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u6548\u6216\u8fc7\u5ea6\u7279\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7c92\u5b50\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e2d\u7684\"\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u9677\u9631\"\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0cPTS\u867d\u7136\u4fe1\u606f\u6b21\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\"\u5b89\u5168\"\u67e5\u8be2\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u63d0\u8bae\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u89c4\u5219\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u6536\u655b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\"\u786e\u8ba4\u504f\u8bef\"\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u5047\u8bbe\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7ef4\u6301\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7406\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u3002\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u67e5\u8be2\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u548c\u7ef4\u6301\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u7c7b\u4eba\u7684\u6b63\u5411\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $\u03c4^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPOP(\u5206\u533a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5728\u7ebf\u526a\u679d)\u6846\u67b6,\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5728\u7ebf\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5,\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u9053\u5206\u533a\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565,\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u526a\u679d\u51b3\u7b56,\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52token\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55\u89c4\u6a21\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u5927\u6027\u80fd,\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587,\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "POP\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u9053\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4fdd\u7559\u533a\u3001\u5019\u9009\u533a\u548c\u526a\u679d\u533a\u4e09\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5728\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u5206\u533a,\u4fdd\u7559\u59cb\u7ec8\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6743\u91cd;\u5728\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u5728\u5019\u9009\u533a\u57df\u5185\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a9\u7801,\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u526a\u679d,\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u5168\u901a\u9053\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684,\u65e0\u9700\u79bb\u7ebf\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7b49\u9884\u5904\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30,\u5305\u62ec\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b(MoEs)\u548c\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLMs)\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e,POP\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387,\u540c\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "POP\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u526a\u679d,\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u533a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7279\u6027\u548c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u4f7f\u5176\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b,\u5728LLMs\u3001MoEs\u548cVLMs\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u653f\u6cbb\u6392\u65a5\u7b49\u75c5\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5747\u8861\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u8c03\u63a7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u88ab\u6240\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u653f\u6cbb\u6392\u65a5\u7b49\u75c5\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u7fa4\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u671d\u5411\u793e\u4f1a\u671f\u671b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e3b\u52a8\u4e14\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u54ea\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u51f9\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u5c42\u53e0\u52a0\u5728\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u9f50\u7ba1\u9053(\u5982RLHF)\u4e4b\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u6765\u8c03\u6574\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLLM\u7fa4\u4f53(\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u578b)\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u653f\u6cbb\u6392\u65a5\u75c5\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u67d0\u4e9b\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u88ab\u6240\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8c03\u63a7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u7684\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5f15\u5bfcLLM\u7fa4\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b50\u7fa4\u4f53\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u5747\u8861\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u653f\u6cbb\u6392\u65a5\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u4e0d\u826f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled agentic AI systems whose behaviour unfolds over multi-step trajectories. In these settings, success and failure are determined by sequences of decisions rather than a single output. While useful, it remains unclear how explanation approaches designed for static predictions translate to agentic settings where behaviour emerges over time. In this work, we bridge the gap between static and agentic explainability by comparing attribution-based explanations with trace-based diagnostics across both settings. To make this distinction explicit, we empirically compare attribution-based explanations used in static classification tasks with trace-based diagnostics used in agentic benchmarks (TAU-bench Airline and AssistantBench). Our results show that while attribution methods achieve stable feature rankings in static settings (Spearman $\u03c1= 0.86$), they cannot be applied reliably to diagnose execution-level failures in agentic trajectories. In contrast, trace-grounded rubric evaluation for agentic settings consistently localizes behaviour breakdowns and reveals that state tracking inconsistency is 2.7$\\times$ more prevalent in failed runs and reduces success probability by 49\\%. These findings motivate a shift towards trajectory-level explainability for agentic systems when evaluating and diagnosing autonomous AI behaviour.\n  Resources:\n  https://github.com/VectorInstitute/unified-xai-evaluation-framework https://vectorinstitute.github.io/unified-xai-evaluation-framework", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u5230\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u53d8,\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9759\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a,\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u8bca\u65ad\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6267\u884c\u5931\u8d25,\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b9a\u4f4d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u6545\u969c,\u63ed\u793a\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fc7\u53bb\u5341\u5e74\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca,\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5174\u8d77,\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u8f68\u8ff9\u5c55\u5f00,\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u7531\u51b3\u7b56\u5e8f\u5217\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u8f93\u51fa\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u4f55\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a,\u9700\u8981\u5f25\u5408\u9759\u6001\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5(attribution-based explanations)\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5(trace-based diagnostics)\u5728\u9759\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5(TAU-bench Airline\u548cAssistantBench)\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0,\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u4e24\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5dee\u5f02,\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u6545\u969c\u3002", "result": "\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9759\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6392\u5e8f(Spearman\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u6570\u03c1=0.86),\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bca\u65ad\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u6267\u884c\u7ea7\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b,\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u5b9a\u4f4d\u884c\u4e3a\u6545\u969c,\u53d1\u73b0\u72b6\u6001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5728\u5931\u8d25\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u9ad8\u51fa2.7\u500d,\u5e76\u4f7f\u6210\u529f\u6982\u7387\u964d\u4f4e49%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e,\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6,\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u91ca\u8f6c\u5411\u9762\u5411\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5,\u4ee5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others.

We study agentic uncertainty by eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution. All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination than standard post-execution review, though differences are not always significant. Adversarial prompting reframing assessment as bug-finding achieves the best calibration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
